/*
    Each node can have either zero, 1 or 2 nodes.
    Each child can only have one parent. 
    Perfect binary tree is when the tree is full, meaning each node as two
    children. PBT is really efficient. Nodes double each level. All the nodes
    above the bottom level added up and plus 1 will equal the bottom level
    that means half of our nodes are on the bottom level.
